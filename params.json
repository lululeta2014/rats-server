{"name":"Remote Android Test Service","tagline":"","body":"RATS: Remote Android Test Service\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/s9Dl1ih.png)\r\n\r\n###What is RATS?\r\nRATS is an easy to run Test Runner Service that can be hosted anywhere a device can be connected.  It was designed to thwart device hogs and provide a level playing field for shops who can't afford more expensive testing services.\r\n\r\nIt should be as simple to setup as it is to run thanks to the [gradle plugin](https://www.github.com/wmbest2/rats-gradle-plugin)\r\n\r\n### Why Rats?\r\n\"RATS!\" was what I anticipated our developers at [VOKAL Interactive](http://www.vokalinteractive.com) saying whenever their tests failed.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nBinaries:\r\n\r\n1. Download the binary for your architecture and os from [here](https://github.com/wmbest2/rats-server/releases/latest)\r\n2. Have a mongo database running (see [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) for more information)\r\n2. `rats-server_os_arch -port 8080 -db mongodb://somehost`\r\n\r\n\r\n####But my FreeBSD machine cant run ADB!\r\n\r\nRun rats with the `adb_address` and `adb_port` flags to point it to another machine!\r\nRun your server in the cloud and your devices on your desk!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Run Your Tests\r\n\r\n  `curl -X POST myserver.local:8080/api/run -F apk=@myapk.apk -F test-apk=@myapk-test.apk`\r\n\r\n  _Seriously, that's it!_\r\n\r\n  Parameters:\r\n\r\n  * `apk` Main apk\r\n  * `test-apk` Test package apk\r\n  * `count` Number of devices\r\n  * `serials` Comma separated list of device serials\r\n  * `strict` Strict mode (will run forever if devices dont match)\r\n  * `message` A description of the run\r\n\r\n###Capabilities\r\n\r\n* Concurrent Test Running on all devices requested\r\n * Devices are held only as long as the test runs freeing them up sooner for more testing\r\n * Active Device monitoring lets you see which devices are in use\r\n* Filter Devices for a particular run\r\n * Device count filter so you don't piss off your coworkers \r\n * Automatic SDK filtering based on manifest parameters\r\n * Strict filtering mode and Serial filters for cases where you must run a particular subset of devices\r\n* Easy to use Api for extra info\r\n\r\n###Gradle Plugin\r\n\r\n[RATS Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/wmbest2/rats-gradle-plugin)\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nbuildscript {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n    }\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.10.+'\r\n        classpath 'com.wmbest.gradle:rats:0.2.+'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\napply plugin: 'android'\r\napply plugin: 'rats'\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Whats Missing / What's to come\r\n\r\n* Proper encoding for Accept headers (e.g. xml for proper junit output)\r\n* Log capture from tests\r\n* Screenshots\r\n* Project Grouping\r\n* Realtime test results\r\n* Ironically: Tests\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nSo far mostly me[(wmbest2)](http://www.github.com/wmbest2), but not without support from [VOKAL Interactive](http://www.vokalinteractive.com)\r\n\r\n### Let's see more!\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/zEnBWu9.png)\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oZsFNNG.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
